# EOCS.NeuralNetworks

This repository includes code (in C#) to facilitate a step-by-step comprehension of how neural networks function in practice, with a specific emphasis on the backpropagation algorithm.

The comprehensive tutorial, along with explanations in plain English, can be accessed on this site: [Implementing neural networks in C#](https://www.elementsofcomputerscience.com/posts/implementing-neural-networks-csharp-01/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=implementing-neural-networks)
